 After running the script to completion with fits and starts, only two dwg files remain unchanged:
 - \wsp-us-pw-02\d0228632\TRC0976_P-PH2-CHN.dwg
 - This is a zero-byte file.

 - \wsp-us-pw-02\d0162142\ver00002\TRC0975_X-PH1-TRK.dwg
 weirdly, this is not showing up in the log.  Could I have skipped it inadvertently by means of the skipTo parameter? 

   Now working .*d0162142\\ver00002\\TRC0975_X-PH1-TRK.dwg
   Now working .*d0339745\\TRC0975_X-PH1-TRK.dwg

 # command to extract the "baseline" tree (i.e. the starting point, extracted from projectwise) to a
 # a specified directory, in preparation for doing a winmerge comparison:
 rm -rf "C:/work/nakano_marginal_way_comparison/1/*"; git -C "C:/work/nakano_marginal_way" --work-tree="C:/work/nakano_marginal_way_comparison/1" checkout baseline1 -- .

 # and checkout the current head tree to another directory:
 rm -rf "C:/work/nakano_marginal_way_comparison/2/*"; git -C "C:/work/nakano_marginal_way" --work-tree="C:/work/nakano_marginal_way_comparison/2" checkout HEAD -- .

 ran the script to completion for with no stops (that's a first)
 excellent: Now, the only dwg file that the script is not modifying is the pathological zero-byte file C:\work\nakano_marginal_way_comparison\1\wsp-us-pw-02\d0228632\TRC0976_P-PH2-CHN.dwg
 the size of the wsp-us-pw-02 directory changed from 1219 megabytes to 992 megabytes, and processing took 18696 seconds.

 Now will run the script on the results of the last run, to compare processing speed.
